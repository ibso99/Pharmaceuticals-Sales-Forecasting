# Rosman Pharmaceuticals Sales Prediction

Welcome to the Rosman Pharmaceuticals Sales Prediction project! This project aims to predict future sales using machine learning models, including LSTM and other techniques.

## Project Structure


### Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models, including LSTM, to predict sales.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained models.

### Notebooks

- **Data_Exploration.ipynb**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- **LSTM.ipynb**: Training and evaluating the LSTM model.
- **ML_predictor.ipynb**: Training and evaluating other machine learning models.

### Scripts

- **LSTM_trainer.py**: Script for training the LSTM model.
- **SalesPredictor.py**: Script for training and evaluating other machine learning models.

### Data

- **store_train_clean_data.csv**: Cleaned training data.
- **store.csv**: Store information data.
- **test.csv**: Test data.
- **train.csv**: Raw training data.

## src Folder

The [`src`](src ) folder contains the source code for the project.

## test Folder

The [`test`](test ) folder contains the test cases for the project.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Results
The trained models are saved in the saved_models folder. You can use these models to make predictions on new data.
